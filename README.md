Human-readable ANSI sequences.

Sequin is a small utility that can help you debug your CLIs and TUIs. It's also
great for describing escape sequences you might not understand, and exploring
what TUIs are doing under the hood.

There are lots more use cases too, like inspecting golden files such as the
ones used by [`teatest`][teatest] to crystalize [Bubble Tea][bubbletea] output.

Are you using Sequin in an interesting way? We’d love to hear about it.

## Examples

### Describing escape sequences

Just use `printf` to send some sequences to `sequin` for an explanation.

```bash
printf "\x1b[38;5;4mCiao, \x1b[1;7mBaby.\x1b[0m\n" | sequin
```

### Reading the output of a program

You can also use it to check the output of any program, for instance, `ls` or `git`.

```bash
ls -1 --color=always | sequin
```

```bash
git -c status.color=always status -sb | sequin
```

So yeah, it’s great for debugging applications, and of course, learning about ANSI!

### Examining golden files

Golden file for TUIs contain ANSI, which can be easily inspected with `sequin`:

```console
$ cat ./testdata/MyCuteApp.golden | sequin
```

To generate golden files for your TUIs have a look at [`golden`][golden] and [`teatest`][teatest] from the [`/x`][x] project.

## How it works

It relies heavily on our glorious [`ansi`][ansi] package, currently in the
elusive [`/x`][x] project. Whilst traversing the strings, Sequin pretty prints
what the sequences are and what they’re doing.

## Is it done?

No! Common sequences are implemented, but there is still plenty of work to
do. For instance, [APC](https://www.apc.fr) sequences are not supported yet. If
you notice one of such missing sequences, or want to work on any other area of
the project, feel free to open a PR. 💘
